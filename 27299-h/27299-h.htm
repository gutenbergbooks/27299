			<p>Pp. 380. 12mo. Elegantly bound in cloth.</p>

			<p>Price $1 00.</p>

			<p>Being a compilation of the original letters from the immortal <strong style="font-weight:normal;font-variant:small-caps;">Q. K. Philander
			Doesticks</strong>, P. B. (Perfect Brick.)</p>

			<p class="ad-testimonial">[From <cite>N. P. Willis&#8217;s Home Journal</cite>.]</p>

			<p class="ad-detail">&#8220;Things so copied, so talked of, so pulled out of every pocket to be lent to you, so quoted,
			and so relished and laughed over as Doesticks&#8217; writings, never were launched into print.&#8221;</p>

			<hr class="short" />

			<p class="ad-title">PLU-RI-BUS-TAH;</p>

			<p>A SONG THATS BY NO AUTHOR&#8212;A DEED WITHOUT A NAME.</p>

			<p>Pp. 264. 12mo. Elegantly bound in cloth.</p>

			<p>Price $1 00.</p>

			<p class="ad-detail">As a History of the country this book is invaluable, inasmuch as it notices a great many events
			not mentioned by Bancroft, Hildreth, or Prescott. As a Novel it is unapproachable, for it contains
			several characters unknown to Cooper, Dickens, Marryatt, or Bulwer. As a Mythological
			Work it should be immediately secured, as it makes mention of a number of gods and deified
			worthies hitherto unknown to old Jupiter himself. As a Poem, its claims to consideration cannot
			be denied, as it comprises a great many beauties not discoverable in the &#8220;Song of Hiawatha,&#8221;
			besides several Indian names which were therein omitted.</p>

			<p>Price $1 00.</p>

			<p class="ad-detail">A veritable and veracious History of the Doings and Misdoings of the members of the Elephant
			Club. With the minute and particular narrative of what they did. To which is added a complex
			and elaborate description of what they didn&#8217;t. Containing also the exultant record of their
			memorable success in eventually obtaining, each and every one, a sight of the entire and unadulterated
			animal, from the primitive hair on his attenuated proboscis, to the last kink of his
			symmetrical tail.</p>

			<p class="ad-title">NOTHING TO SAY;</p>

		<p>To always write Nothings, while Nothings will pay,</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page9" title="9">&nbsp;</a>I mention this fact in advance, that Miss P***</p>

		<p>That her Reverend friend may attend to his Litany,</p>
		<p>And leave me my fame, if perchance I shall get any.</p>
		<p>I deemed it best, to set at rest,</p>
		<p>This question before it was started, lest</p>
		<p>Some terrible girl from the far coun<em>tree</em>,</p>
		<p>Without proper regard to veraci<em>tee</em>,</p>
		<p>Should haste to town, to drag me down</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page10" title="10">&nbsp;</a>From my envied post of poetic renown.</p>
		<p>Miss P***, I&#8217;ve a favor to ask.&#8212;If &#8217;tis true,</p>
		<p>That &#8220;Nothing to Wear,&#8221; and &#8220;Nothing to Do,&#8221;</p>
		<p>And &#8220;Nothing to Eat,&#8221; were all written by you,&#8212;</p>
		<p>Let those three Nothings content you I pray,</p>
		<p>Say nothing yourself; leave me &#8220;Nothing to Say.&#8221;</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page11" title="11">&nbsp;</a>From time immemorial, people of fashion</p>
		<p class="i2">  Have been the target of poets and penny wits,</p>
		<p>And been lampooned without stint or compassion,</p>
		<p class="i2">  From Dan to Beersheba&#8212;from Dublin to Dennevitz;</p>
		<p>And our now-a-day rhymsters, taking the cue,</p>
		<p>Have aimed all their shots at the Fifth Avenue,</p>
		<p>Till the clever author of &#8220;Nothing to Wear,&#8221;</p>
		<p>Fired his broadside at Madison Square.</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page12" title="12">&nbsp;</a>Now <em>I</em> don&#8217;t consider this sort of thing personal,</p>
		<p class="i2">  <em>I&#8217;m</em> not a bit of a dandy or fop;</p>
		<p>But the seed it is constantly sowing, is worse than all</p>
		<p class="i2">  Others, and bears a most plentiful crop;</p>
		<p>For it all goes to strengthen the popular fallacy</p>
		<p>That, because a man lives in a &#8220;brown stone palace&#8221; he</p>
		<p>Must be a miser, a rogue and a knave,</p>
		<p>Without soul enough to condemn or to save&#8212;</p>

		<p class="i2">That the &#8220;villanous rich&#8221; wear a cloak and a mask, all,</p>
		<p class="i2">And the greater the riches, the greater the rascal.</p>
		<p>That the cardinal virtues only endure,</p>

		<p>That nowhere are found the true Christian graces,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page16" title="16">&nbsp;</a>Save closely allied to the dirtiest faces.</p>
		<p>I shall not contradict this delightful tradition,</p>

		<p>To state, that I think there&#8217;s a word to be said,</p>
		<p>From a different text, on the opposite head.</p>
		<p>And so I&#8217;ll invent, as well as I&#8217;m able,</p>
		<p>A new home-made, allegorical fable;</p>
		<p>And my honest purpose shall be, to see</p>
		<p class="i2"><a class="pagenum" id="page17" title="17">&nbsp;</a>If the scoundrel rich have not borne a part</p>
		<p>In those noble charities, which are</p>
		<p class="i2">The pride of this jolly old city&#8217;s heart.</p>
		<p>And if I shall find that the virtuous mob</p>
		<p class="i2">Have ever been known one farthing to pay,</p>
		<p class="i2">Without hoping a hundred-fold profit to make:</p>
		<p>Where the &#8220;rich man,&#8221; the &#8220;miser,&#8221; &#8220;aristocrat,&#8221; &#8220;snob,&#8221;</p>
		<p>Has poured out his thousands for Charity&#8217;s sake,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page18" title="18">&nbsp;</a>I&#8217;ll lay down my pen, and have &#8220;Nothing to Say.&#8221;</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>I shall not describe the <strong class="special-emphasis">Spirit of Cant</strong>,</p>
		<p>Of popular humbug, and vulgar rant,</p>
		<p class="i2">And tell how he looks in a tangible form,</p>
		<p>And give the length of his horns and claws,</p>
		<p>The spread of his wings, the width of his jaws,</p>
		<p>And detail the other proportions grim,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page19" title="19">&nbsp;</a>Which belong to a powerful demon like him.</p>
		<p>Go and look at the melodramatic stage,</p>
		<p>When a &#8220;spectacle&#8221; piece is all the rage;</p>
		<p class="i2">And there, in the midst of some &#8220;property&#8221; storm,</p>
		<p>While the sheet-iron thunder is rattling its best,</p>
		<p>And the rosin lightning, and all the rest</p>
		<p>Of the elements are, for some tragedy-reason,</p>
		<p>Making the &#8220;awfullest gale of the season&#8212;&#8221;</p>
		<p>See, at the sound of the prompter&#8217;s tap,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page20" title="20">&nbsp;</a>The fiend come up through the &#8220;Vampyre trap;&#8221;</p>
		<p>Take a mental photograph then, and there,</p>
		<p class="i2">Of that imp, with his &#8220;fixins&#8221; all complete&#8212;</p>
		<p>The elfish grin, the tangled hair,</p>
		<p class="i2">The dragon wings and the scaly feet&#8212;</p>
		<p>And you&#8217;ll have a notion of him I mean,</p>
		<p>The demon of this, my opening scene.</p>
		<p>I might go to Milton, and steal, bit by bit,</p>
		<p class="i2">A description to suit my Spirit of Cant,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page21" title="21">&nbsp;</a>A second-hand suit, but a &#8220;shplendid fit,&#8221;</p>
		<p class="i2">As a Jew would assure me&#8212;but then I sha&#8217;nt.</p>
		<p>His work is to preach the humbug which passes</p>
		<p>For gospel among the &#8220;down-trodden masses;&#8221;</p>
		<p>And to prate of the &#8220;wrongs and indignities,&#8221; which</p>
		<p>Are heaped on their heads by the &#8220;cold-hearted rich.&#8221;</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page22" title="22">&nbsp;</a>This Spirit was busy at work one day,</p>
		<p class="i2">Amongst a crowd of Bowery boys,</p>
		<p>When <strong class="special-emphasis">Charity</strong> happened to come that way;</p>

		<p class="i2">She seldom is fond of clamor and noise.</p>

		<p class="i2">Till you tell us: What did Charity wear?</p>
		<p>Was her dress of <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">moire antique</em>, or satin;</p>
		<p>Or was it plain muslin&#8212;just like that in</p>
		<p>Which love-lorn maidens on the stage</p>
		<p>Go raving crazy?&#8212;and had she a page?</p>
		<p>Did she wear hoops? and what sort of a bonnet?</p>
		<p>And tell us, what kind of trimming was on it?</p>
		<p class="i2">What&#8212;&#8221; Stop, stop, dear ladies, it isn&#8217;t fair</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page26" title="26">&nbsp;</a>To question thus closely a modest young man.</p>
		<p class="i2">If I <em>could</em> tell the items, I would, I declare;</p>
		<p>For I always oblige you whenever I can.</p>
		<p>I know that of dresses she has a variety,</p>
		<p class="i2">Though vanity&#8217;s not her predominant passion,</p>
		<p>She was costumed, no doubt, with the greatest propriety,</p>
		<p class="i2">In the very extreme of the reigning fashion.</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page27" title="27">&nbsp;</a>Well! she stopped to listen, a minute or more,</p>
		<p>To the fellow&#8217;s mischievous harangue, before</p>
		<p>She resolved what to do; then she stepped to the door</p>
		<p class="i2">Of an Astor Place car, and beckoned to him,</p>
		<p>And he followed at once, while his audience scattered;</p>
		<p>To tell the truth, he felt quite flattered,</p>
		<p class="i2">And he smiled a smile most heavy and grim,</p>
		<p>For he thought he&#8217;d awakened a tender passion</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page28" title="28">&nbsp;</a>In the heart of a belle, a lady of fashion.</p>
		<p>And they sat side by side, this curious pair,</p>
		<p>While they rode up to Eighth street&#8212;and she paid the fare.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>They stepped from the car, and stood before,</p>
		<p>The &#8220;<strong class="special-emphasis">Cooper Institute&#8217;s</strong>&#8221; new-painted door&#8212;</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page29" title="29">&nbsp;</a>&#8220;Who hath done this?&#8221; asked Charity then;</p>
		<p>&#8220;Who hath done this for his fellow-men?</p>
		<p class="i2">Hath builded  this  house, that all may come&#8212;</p>
		<p>The poor most welcome&#8212;to Learning&#8217;s treasure,</p>
		<p>And drink their fill without stint or measure?</p>
		<p>Who hath so nobly used his thrift,</p>
		<p>And bestowed on the world this priceless gift,</p>
		<p class="i2">Free to all, whoever may come?</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page30" title="30">&nbsp;</a>Was this noble work built up by the &#8216;masses,&#8217;</p>
		<p>Or by one of the &#8216;miserly, upper classes&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>To the Spirit, this speech was quite unexpected,</p>
		<p class="i2">And he stood in a sort of stupid dismay;</p>
		<p>And before his few scattered thoughts were collected,</p>
		<p class="i2">She rightly concluded&#8212;he&#8217;d Nothing to Say.</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page31" title="31">&nbsp;</a>Then she lifted her skirts with a masterly hand,</p>
		<p class="i2">And out of the puddles and ruts kept them well up,&#8212;</p>
		<p>Thus showed that she had the most perfect command</p>
		<p class="i2">Of the crinoline mysteries of her envelope,</p>
		<p>&#8217;Twas done with the daintiest grace all the while,</p>
		<p class="i2">And discovered the daintiest possible gaiter,&#8212;</p>
		<p>Then she turned to her friend with a nod and a smile,</p>
		<p class="i2"><a class="pagenum" id="page32" title="32">&nbsp;</a>And told him to follow&#8212;he straightway obeyed her.</p>
		<p>As they hurried along, she kept ever before him,</p>
		<p>And he kept his eye on the tempting prunella,</p>
		<p>Secretly hoping there&#8217;d come such a shower</p>
		<p class="i2">As would make a new Flood in half-an-hour&#8212;</p>
		<p>That she, with a womanly care for her bonnet,</p>
		<p class="i2">Which would &#8220;spot,&#8221; with the least drop of water upon it,</p>

		<p class="i2">They reached the huge Library&#8212;christened of Astor.</p>
		<p>Then she shook down her skirts to their natural latitude&#8212;</p>
		<p class="i2">Ahem&#8217;d once or twice&#8212;struck <em>out</em> a nice attitude&#8212;</p>
		<p>And then she struck <em>into</em> this little oration,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page36" title="36">&nbsp;</a>Though I&#8217;m sure <em>I</em> don&#8217;t know where she learned declamation.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p class="i2">&#8220;Spirit, behold! these bending shelves</p>
		<p>Are groaning &#8217;neath the gathered store</p>
		<p>Of every nation&#8217;s varied lore.</p>
		<p class="i2">Most welcome are the poor themselves</p>
		<p>To freely turn these countless pages,</p>
		<p>And gather from the words of sages</p>
		<p>All the light of former ages.</p>
		<p>Whoever wills is here a guest,</p>
		<p>The <em>poorest</em> are the welcomest.</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page37" title="37">&nbsp;</a>Who hath done this? your virtuous mob,</p>
		<p>Or a &#8216;cold-hearted miser,&#8217; a &#8216;pampered snob&#8217;?&#8221;</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>Here her Companion began to perceive</p>
		<p class="i2">That her feminine tongue would have its own way;</p>
		<p>That the cleverest thing <em>he</em> could do was to leave</p>
		<p class="i2">The talking to her, and have Nothing to Say.</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page38" title="38">&nbsp;</a>The lady had now been chattering so long,</p>
		<p class="i2">She felt that her voice was beginning to fail her;</p>
		<p>A punch would, she felt, be a blessing and boon,</p>
		<p class="i2">The &#8220;dientical&#8221; thing with which to regale her,</p>
		<p>So they pushed their way through the gathering throng,</p>
		<p class="i2">And hurried away to Taylor&#8217;s Saloon.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page39" title="39">&nbsp;</a>They seated themselves at the table together,&#8212;</p>
		<p>The customers &#8220;staring their eyes out,&#8221; to see</p>
		<p>Who this queer-looking couple could possibly be,&#8212;</p>
		<p>Asking each other in whispers, whether,</p>
		<p>It wasn&#8217;t the likeliest thing that she,</p>
		<p>Was a Western Actress, and he an Editor;</p>
		<p>And some were terribly frightened, because</p>
		<p>They couldn&#8217;t help thinking there certainly was,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page40" title="40">&nbsp;</a>The Old Nick to pay, and that he was their creditor.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>But the strangers composedly sat, never heeding</p>
		<p class="i2">These stupid remarks, or taking offence,</p>
		<p>And they quietly kept on their drinking and feeding,</p>
		<p class="i2">Without the slightest regard to expense.</p>
		<p>If an appetite sharp is a thing so delightful,</p>
		<p class="i2"><a class="pagenum" id="page41" title="41">&nbsp;</a>Charity had no occasion to sigh at hers;</p>
		<p>Boarding-house keepers would say it was frightful,</p>
		<p class="i2">And ruinous too, to the hotel proprietors.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>They were sated at last, and turned from the door;</p>
		<p class="i2">He, wondering whither she now would go&#8212;</p>
		<p>And well he might&#8212;in an instant more</p>
		<p class="i2">He was over shoes in the frozen snow;</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page42" title="42">&nbsp;</a>While she coolly remarked, with a Camille cough,</p>
		<p>That the North Pole was only a half a mile off.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>How it was they got to their present location,</p>
		<p>I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t know, and it&#8217;s not my vocation</p>
		<p class="i2">To give the details of their quick locomotion.</p>
		<p>Electricity may have done it, or steam;</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page45" title="45">&nbsp;</a>But motive powers are not my theme.</p>
		<p class="i2">My heroes were there, near the frozen ocean.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>The man had too much of &#8220;cold without,&#8221;</p>
		<p class="i2">And the lady sighed for her tippet and muff;</p>
		<p>For though they had come by a summary route,</p>
		<p class="i2">The weather, they found, was wintry enough.</p>
		<p class="i2"><a class="pagenum" id="page46" title="46">&nbsp;</a>When  they  climbed  an  iceberg&#8217;s loftiest height,</p>
		<p>To the imminent danger of dresses and hoops,</p>
		<p>Of ribbons and pins, and laces and loops,</p>
		<p class="i2">The <strong class="special-emphasis">Grinnell Expedition</strong> was in sight.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>Now the lady had been prepared to preach,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page47" title="47">&nbsp;</a>Or rather, to make a nice serious speech;</p>
		<p>But it might as well have been written in Dutch for her,</p>
		<p>For the wind and the weather, conspiring together,</p>
		<p>Turned out to be, altogether too much for her;</p>
		<p>One half she forgot, and she bungled the rest of it,</p>
		<p>Though I finally managed to pick out the best of it.</p>
		<p>She asked her companion, who stood in the lee of her,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page48" title="48">&nbsp;</a>For the wind spread her skirts to the bigness of three of her,</p>
		<p>&#8220;Who sent these ships to the rescue of those,</p>
		<p>Who have perilled their lives in these Northern snows?</p>
		<p>Did he spring from the mob, the benevolent &#8216;masses,&#8217;</p>
		<p>Or from the detestable &#8216;upper classes&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
		<p>With a great deal more to the same effect,</p>
		<p class="i2">Which I couldn&#8217;t exactly make out the sense of,</p>
		<p>For I know that her sentences &#8220;failed to connect;&#8221;</p>
		<p class="i2"><a class="pagenum" id="page49" title="49">&nbsp;</a>And I suppose that her chattering teeth bit the ends off;</p>
		<p>But &#8217;twas very conclusive, whatever she said.</p>
		<p class="i2">He never disputed her; never said nay,</p>
		<p>But only hung down his discomfited head;</p>
		<p class="i2">And whatever he thought, he had Nothing to Say.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page50" title="50">&nbsp;</a>Chilled to the heart with the terrible cold,</p>
		<p class="i2">Both to get back were most truly-solicitous,</p>
		<p>Never before was the saying old,</p>
		<p class="i2">&#8220;As cold as charity,&#8221; half so felicitous.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>They hastened back to Broadway, when she said,</p>
		<p class="i2">That one more journey that night she&#8217;d lead him,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page51" title="51">&nbsp;</a>Before she&#8217;d let him go home to bed.</p>
		<p>And he, not caring to quibble or question,</p>
		<p>At once fell in with the lady&#8217;s suggestion,</p>
		<p class="i2">Not thinking she&#8217;d &#8220;one more&#8221; lecture to read him.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>This time they took a course rectilinear</p>
		<p>Southward, and landed in Norfolk, Virginia.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page52" title="52">&nbsp;</a>Pestilence there was doing its worst,</p>
		<p class="i2">Hundreds were dying, and hundreds were dead.</p>
		<p>Many who should have been bravest, the first</p>
		<p class="i2">Had deserted their trust, and shamelessly fled.</p>
		<p>But men from the Northern cities were there,</p>
		<p>Nursing the sick with the tenderest care,</p>
		<p>Whose kindred had fled to less dangerous lands,</p>
		<p>Leaving the dying to strangers&#8217; hands.</p>

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page55" title="55">&nbsp;</a>While the two stood quiet beside the bed</p>
		<p>Of a patient sufferer, Charity said:</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>&#8220;Who hath sent these strangers here,</p>
		<p>These dying men to soothe and cheer?</p>
		<p>To do what mortal skill may do</p>
		<p>To lighten their burdens of grief and woe;</p>
		<p>To shrive these dying souls of blame,</p>
		<p class="i2">To bid them hope in Heaven above.</p>
		<p>Who hath sent these in my dear name</p>
		<p class="i2"><a class="pagenum" id="page56" title="56">&nbsp;</a>To do this holiest work of love?</p>
		<p>Hath the treasure here given been paid by those</p>
		<p class="i2">Whose &#8216;wrongs&#8217; are so earnestly plead by you?</p>
		<p>Or hath it been done by their &#8216;natural foes,&#8217;</p>
		<p class="i2">The wealthy, the rich, the opulent few</p>
		<p class="i2">Of Madison Square and the Fifth Avenue?&#8221;</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page57" title="57">&nbsp;</a>During this lengthy interrogation</p>
		<p class="i2">The Spirit had been pretending to doze,</p>
		<p class="i2">But he waked himself up at the peroration,</p>
		<p>And most ungallantly turned up his nose,</p>
		<p>And turned on his heel, and turned him away,&#8212;</p>
		<p>Sulkily saying, he&#8217;d Nothing to Say.</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p>Dear Readers, I&#8217;ll ask one question of you&#8212;</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page58" title="58">&nbsp;</a>Don&#8217;t you think it may possibly chance to be true,</p>
		<p>That Charity, really, not merely in fables,</p>
		<p>May apparel herself in satins and sables,</p>
		<p>And costliest ribbons, and fragilest laces,</p>
		<p class="i2">Like the daintiest beauties of Madison Square,</p>
		<p>And may take up a home in the loftiest places,</p>
		<p class="i2">With those who&#8217;ve, satirically, Nothing to Wear?</p>

		<hr class="short" />

		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page59" title="59">&nbsp;</a>And in that blissful realm above,</p>
		<p>Where the poor and the rich meet in meekness and love:</p>
		<p>Where the works of each heart are unveiled to the light,</p>
		<p>And Humbug and Cant yield to Truth and to Right&#8212;</p>
		<p>Where the trickster lays off his mask of deceit,</p>
		<p>And the cloak of the hypocrite drops to his feet,</p>
		<p>And Honor is given, where Honor is due&#8212;</p>
		<p>We <em>may</em> see that some from the Fifth Avenue,</p>
		<p><a class="pagenum" id="page60" title="60">&nbsp;</a>Most nobly will speak in that great reckoning day,</p>
		<p>While their  earthly  detractors  have <strong class="fancy">Nothing to Say</strong>.</p>
